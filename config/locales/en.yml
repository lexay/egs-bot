# If you want your own custom localised version of the app, you can do the
# following:
#
# For the 'country' entry you can choose your 2 digits country code, which you
# can look up using Wikipedia.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_in_the_International_Organization_for_Standardization
# 
# For the 'locale' entry choose one from listed and supported: ar, de, en-US,
# es-ES, es-MX, fr, it, ja, ko, pl, pt-BR, ru, th, tr, zh-CN, zh-Hant
#
# So, in short, you can combine the above two codes to produce a meaningful
# output, which will be parsed and piped to Telegram.
