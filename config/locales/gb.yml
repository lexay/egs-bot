# Note: This yml file is not only about switching to your locale of choice with
# all the app output in Telegram translated for you in you native language but
# also it is the config for the API requests.
# 
# The 'country' entry here is especially important to receive valid info for
# parsing, you should be more careful, when manipulating it.
# 
# You can choose A2 code of your country from this list down below
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_in_the_International_Organization_for_Standardization
# of course if EGS is available in the country / region of your choosing. If not
# - pick some other one.
# 
# The locale you wish to choose for the info that will be presented to you in
# your language alongside with all the rest entries, that's up to you!
# You can check all the available locales supported by EGS by clicking the
# language selector menu in the navigation bar.
# 
# Why all the fuss?
# 
# Free games are not up for grabs across the entire EGS platform worldwide and
# several titles are even banned in some regions. So in order to be notified
# when a free game is out on EGS, you may want to change the country / region
# for the request, otherwise you wont be notified at all if the game is banned.
# Then you can use VPN and change your EGS account's regon / country temporarily
# (6 months) and you should be able to get it.
