### A few words about the dev and how this all started
Hi, I'm Alex. And this is my first big project. It was intended for a friend who
did not want any free release from EGS slipping behind his ears. I started it as
a total noob, and as the project grew and I got more skilled with Ruby (my
favorite programming language btw!) it received more valuable updates.

### About the project
App on the main branch(this one) is designed to work on a free tear instance of
Heroku exploiting Ruby Threads just for practice and fun.

I wanna dive into Docker some more(exciting piece of Tech!), so future commits
may come also into a new Docker branch in a reshaped Docker like structure with
separate processes instead of Ruby Threads.

TODO:

Docker version.

CHANGES:

Major release 1.0 6/13/2022

App still works no matter what :-) and got I18n implemented for folks from
around the globe who wanna use it or wish to take part in the project  :-)
